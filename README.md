In the rapidly evolving technological era, intelligent agents have become vital tools across various industries. 
This project aims to hands-on engage in the creation of one's own intelligent agent. 
Through this process, participants are not only expected to gain a profound understanding of the underlying principles of agents \
but also to master key skills such as programming, algorithm design, and data processing in practice. 
This endeavor is not merely a journey of technological exploration but also an opportunity for self-challenge and personal growth, 
enabling everyone to learn through creation and innovate through learning.
